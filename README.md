# Phone Number Formatter

A console application that formats American (US) phone numbers 

## Description 

I originally wrote this Java application as part of an interview for a programmer / software 
developer position. The Java code for this application was written in cira 2013. 

Fast forward to 2020, I was cleaning out old files and I decided that I would refactor the 
application to .NET Core. I recorded a video of me refactoring this application in .NET 
Core. You can watch this video at
